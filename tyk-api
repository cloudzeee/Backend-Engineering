 🌐 What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

 📖 Real-World Analogy
Imagine a restaurant:
- You are the customer.
- The kitchen is the system preparing your food.
- The waiter is the API.

You tell the waiter what you want (your request), the waiter passes the order to the kitchen, and then returns with your food (the response). Similarly, an API takes a request from one system, delivers it to another, and returns the result.

 🧰 Types of APIs

APIs come in several types, each with its own method for handling requests and data:

- REST (Representational State Transfer): Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and is widely used for web services.
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): Relies on XML-based messaging for communication.
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call): Allows executing functions on a remote server as if they were local.
- GraphQL: Lets clients specify exactly what data they need using a flexible query language.

 🛠️ What is API Management?

API Management (APIM) platforms provide tools to:
- Design and develop APIs
- Deploy and secure them
- Monitor, maintain, and analyze their usage

These tools help manage the entire API lifecycle, making it easier for developers and administrators to control and optimize API usage.

 🚀 What is Tyk Gateway?

Tyk Gateway is an open-source, high-performance API gateway designed for speed and enterprise-level features. It acts as a central point to manage and control all API traffic.

 Key Functions of Tyk Gateway:
- Access Control: Ensures only authorized users can access your APIs.
- Rate Limiting: Controls how many requests each user can make.
- Authentication & Authorization: Verifies user identities and their permissions.
- Request/Response Transformation: Modifies requests and responses as needed.
- Analytics Collection: Gathers data on API usage.
- Custom Middleware: Allows you to add custom logic to the API flow.

 🔐 How Does Tyk Gateway Process a Request?

Here’s how a typical request flows through Tyk Gateway:

1. Authentication:  
   Tyk checks for a valid API key (like a password) in the request. It verifies the key using Redis, a fast in-memory database.

2. Rate Limiting:  
   If rate limits are set, Tyk checks if the user has exceeded their quota.

3. Authorization:  
   Tyk checks if the API key has permission to access the requested API.

4. Request Processing:  
   Tyk applies any configured middleware, transformations, or custom logic.

5. Forwarding:  
   The request is sent to the actual backend API server.

6. Analytics:  
   Tyk logs request and response data in Redis for monitoring and analysis.

> Note: When you update your API configuration, Tyk Gateway automatically reloads the latest settings from the database.

 📊 What is Tyk Pump?

Tyk Pump is an open-source analytics processor. It moves analytics data collected by Tyk Gateway (stored in Redis) to a long-term database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. This allows you to view API usage statistics and insights in the Tyk Dashboard or Developer Portal.

 🔁 Tyk Pump Data Flow

```
Tyk Gateway → Redis → Tyk Pump → Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) → Tyk Dashboard/Portal

 🏗️ Creating an API in Tyk

Suppose your backend API is hosted at `http://httpbingo.org/`. Here’s how you’d expose it through Tyk:

1. Identify Available Endpoints:  
   - Check the API documentation or Swagger page for available endpoints (e.g., `/uuid`).

2. Create the API in Tyk:  
   - In the Tyk Dashboard, create a new API.
   - Set `http://httpbingo.org/` as the upstream server.
   - Fill in the required details (name, base path, security settings, etc.).

3. Test Your API Gateway:  
   - After saving, copy the API’s base URL from the Tyk Dashboard (e.g., `https://your-gateway-domain/httpbingo/`).
   - Use a tool like Postman to test an endpoint. For example, to test the `uuid` endpoint, send a GET request to:  
     ```
     https://your-gateway-domain/httpbingo/uuid
     ```
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a `200 OK` response with data from the backend API.

Tyk handles API authentication by validating incoming requests against a set of configurable authentication mechanisms. Here's a breakdown of how Tyk handles API authentication:

---

 🔐 Authentication Flow in Tyk Gateway

When a client sends a request to an API managed by Tyk, the Gateway checks the request based on the authentication method configured for that API. The supported methods include:

---

 ✅ 1. API Key Authentication
- How it works: Clients include an API key (usually in a header like `Authorization` or query string).
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Tyk extracts the key from the request.
  - Validates the key against Redis (where key sessions are stored).
  - Applies access rights, rate limits, and quotas associated with the key.

---

 ✅ 2. JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
- How it works: Clients send a signed JWT in a header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Verifies the token signature using a public key or secret.
  - Optionally validates claims (e.g., expiry, audience).
  - Can map claims to API access rights or inject metadata.

---

 ✅ 3. OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- How it works: Tyk can be configured as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server or integrate with external ones.
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Handles token generation and validation (when using Tyk OAuth).
  - Enforces scopes, token expiration, and client secrets.
  - Token introspection can be enabled.

---

 ✅ 4. OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- How it works: Built on top of OAuth 2.0, used for federated identity (e.g., SSO).
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Validates ID tokens issued by an Identity Provider (IdP).
  - Claims can be used for user identification and access control.

---

 ✅ 5. HMAC Authentication
- How it works: Request is signed with a secret key.
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Reconstructs the request signature server-side.
  - Verifies it matches the one sent.
  - Prevents tampering and provides authentication.

---

 ✅ 6. Basic Authentication
- How it works: Uses HTTP basic auth headers (`username:password`).
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Compares with stored credentials for validation.
  - Often used for internal or testing scenarios.

---

 ✅ 7. Keyless (Open) Access
- How it works: No authentication; any request is allowed.
- Tyk Behavior:
  - Skips authentication checks.
  - Useful for public APIs or prototyping.

 🔁 Tyk Auth Process Flow (Simplified)

```plaintext
Client Request → Tyk Gateway → Auth Check (Key/JWT/OAuth etc.) → 
  [✓ Valid?] → Proceed → Rate Limiting/Authorization/Middleware → Upstream API
  [✗ Invalid?] → Reject (e.g., 403 Forbidden)
```

---

 🔒 Security Add-ons:
- IP whitelisting/blacklisting
- Client certificate validation (mutual TLS)
- Header injection/removal based on auth method
